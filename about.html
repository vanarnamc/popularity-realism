                The urge to categorize comes with the territory of what it means to be human. We document, order, and organize. The extension of technology has lended to us a meaning of category beyond the scope of ethics, into a new territory of stimulation, and personalized advertisements. A new age of bureaucratic rule is no longer in the hands of DMV clerks, or signage filers, but instead in the categorization of humans, and objects for capital gain, gain of power, or gain of control. Nonetheless, this categorization is a dominance depicted by and around those in power.

                Machine learning algorithms claim to be objective, adding quantification onto a world of images, and media. But this objectivity is reliant on pretrained models, with many flaws attached. This project takes a critical look at hyper consumer culture. The work uses machine learning object detection algorithms to process archival footage of consumer habits, and instructional marketing videos from the past. Using limited language output detection models, the work focuses on finding the fundamental flaws in our vision of utopia through consumerism, and through tahe media.

                Moreover, the use of ambient music acts as a critique on the promise of moments of peace and equanimity. A promise by those in power while installing more surveillance, and giving up more liberty.
